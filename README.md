I think that the best choice for this is the list, but i want to work out different data structures. Check releases if you want look at how this application works with different structures

                                /\_____  \ /\   __  \  /\   __  \ 
                                \/____/  / \ \  \/\  \ \ \  \/\  \ 
                                     /  /   \ \  \ \  \ \ \  \ \  \
