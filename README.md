# Zoo on C++
I think that the best choice for this is the list, but i want to work out different data structures
 
                                 ________   ________    ________ 
                                /\_____  \ /\   __  \  /\   __  \ 
                                \/____/  / \ \  \/\  \ \ \  \/\  \ 
                                     /  /   \ \  \ \  \ \ \  \ \  \ 
                                    /  /____ \ \  \_\  \ \ \  \_\  \ 
                                   /\_______\ \ \_______\ \ \_______\
